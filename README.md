Topic: Quantum Computing und seine Bedeutung für die digitale Sicherheit
Quantum computing and its implications on digital security

Description: Wann kommt Quantum Computing? Was bedeutet das für die digitale Sicherheit? 

### Literature Research

- "Any computational problem solvavble by a classical computer is also solvabe by a quantum computer. Intuitively, it is believed that all physical phenomena, including the operation of classical computers, can be described using quantum mechanics, which underlies the operation of quantum computers"
- Quantum computing is a type of computation that harnesses the collective properties of quantum states, such as superposition, interference, and entanglement, to perform calculations.
- Feynman was among the fewer to attemt to provide conceptually a new kind of computers which could be devised based on the priciples on quantum physics. He constructed an abstract model to ...
- Applications 
    - Cryptography
    - Search problems
    - Simulations of quantum systems
    - Quantum annealing and adiabatic optimization
    - Machine Learning 
    - Computational biology
    - Computer-aided drug design and generative chemistry
- As parts are getting smaller, quantum physics approaches. Another way of using natur to do computing
- IBM Q Experience. Cloud Quantum Computing Experience
- Google Bristlecone 72 qbits 
- Scientists say you need 50 qbits for quantum supremacy
- We need quantum algorithms
- Girolamo Cardano, probability theory and complex numbers 
- post quantum security almost always means post quantum cryptography
